# Conway's Game of life

This implementation has been focused on functional programming. So I tried to slove this problem with following of guidelines of functional programming. 

To do that, I used @Value annotation of Project lombok, and Vavr library.

Wiht @Value annotation I could simply crate an immutable object which contains only getters, and one constructor with all arguments.

Vavr library is a functional library for java. I could simply reduce the amount of my code, and develop it on efficient way with this library.
